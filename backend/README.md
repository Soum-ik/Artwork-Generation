I have now set up the core backend infrastructure, including project setup, a modular structure, authentication, and file uploads. All the required security middleware is in place, and the database models for users and uploads are defined.

Here's a summary of what's been completed:
- Project Setup: Express server with all required dependencies.
- Folder Structure: Clean and modular, as requested.
- Authentication: JWT-based signup and login are fully functional. A middleware is in place to protect routes.
- File Uploads: Users can upload artwork, which is saved on the server, and a corresponding record is created in the database.
- User-Specific Routes: An endpoint to fetch all uploads for a logged-in user is ready.
- Security: Essential security middleware like helmet and cors are configured.
- Database: Mongoose is connected, and User and Upload schemas are defined.

- The following major pieces are still pending:
Base Image Generation: Integration with the Hugging Face API.
Secure Download: An endpoint to allow users to download their final artwork.
Job Triggering: The system to communicate with the Python service for image processing.
I'll pause here. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed. We can move on to the Hugging Face integration, implement the download functionality, or set up the job triggering system.
